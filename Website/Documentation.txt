1. Project description: This is a website of the movie that was done during the first week of classes. 
The goal of the website is to be as much annoying as possible, so that is why there is a lot of "hello"
all over the website and the video has a very huge size. 

2. Process: The whole concept came to my mind when we filmed the video. It was a bit annoying
so I thought the website might as well be annoying. I have tried to implement a video carousel where 
the next slide is always the same video. I have created a carousel of photos, but things went wrong 
when i put in the iframe. To save up time I had deleted the broken carousel and just left the video. 
I have played around with navigation bar and have successfuly implemented the buttons to work
but since i have no other pages it leads to the same page. Also I have added the footer which
hold some informations as the logo of the university, my information and the names of the creators
of the video. 

3. Reflection/Evaluations: My expectations were very high, but since it is my first (first and a half) experience 
in developing websites, it turned out to be very confusing and time consuming. It is way harder
than coding in C# or C++ and i expected to be more simple. I was quite wrong so thats why my
website didnt really meet the expectations of what I initially intended. I tried to cover the main
goals in the grading rubric such as "Storytelling, code quality, technichal implementation, creativity 
and user experience". But still even having these five main goals doesn't really satisfy the look of the website.
